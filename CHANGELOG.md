# Changelog

All notable changes to this fork are documented here.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-30

### HearthDB price history
- If `HearthDB.dll` is installed, price history is stored in `CustomData/aux-history.db` (SQLite) instead of SavedVariables. Reads are cached, writes are batched and sent to HearthDB's background thread, and flushed on closing the AH and on logout.
- Existing SavedVariables history is copied over automatically in small steps; `/aux hdb` shows the status, `/aux hdb clean` removes the old copy afterwards.
- Without HearthDB nothing changes (SavedVariables as before). If a database write fails, data falls back to SavedVariables.

### Fixes
- pfui theme: item icons in the Post tab (inventory list and item slot) could be invisible. The icon border is now drawn on its own frame instead of through pfUI's HandleIcon.
- Auctions / Bids tab no longer stays on "loading" when you have many auctions: owner/bidder page requests now time out, are retried (2s/4s back-off) and finally abort with a "click Refresh" message.
- Servers that send the whole owner list at once are handled: all auctions are read (previously only the first 50) with no duplicate page requests.

### Themes
- New `pfui` theme: `/aux theme pfui`. Uses pfUI's colors, font and class color when pfUI is installed (pfUI defaults otherwise). `/aux theme` now cycles blizzard > modern > pfui.
- pfui theme now calls pfUI's own skin functions (CreateBackdrop, CreateBackdropShadow, SkinButton, SkinScrollbar, SkinArrowButton, HandleIcon) when pfUI is loaded, so the window, buttons, search fields, tabs, scrollbars, dropdown arrows and icons use exactly the same backdrop, border, shadow and hover colors as pfUI's Blizzard skin. Without pfUI it falls back to the previous look.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-06

Tooltip readability update preserving the existing aux pricing model and Auction House workflow.

### Tooltips

- Replaced colored decimal-style AUX money strings with Blizzard gold, silver and copper coin icons.
- Money values now use white tooltip text and right-aligned Auctionator-style positioning.
- Renamed the visible `Value:` tooltip label to `Auction:` while keeping the existing internal `settings.value` and historical pricing logic unchanged.
- Added dynamic tooltip width handling for large prices and reset the minimum width when the tooltip closes.
- Preserved integer copper display for fractional internal disenchant expectations.

### Compatibility & validation

- No changes to SavedVariables, price history, LFT `AuxData` sharing, Auction House throttling or posting behaviour.
- No new `OnUpdate` handler or permanent polling was introduced.
- Validated in-game on WoW 1.12.1 / Turtle WoW, including different price sizes and native tooltip money display.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-05

First formal release of the performance-focused `aux-addon-ClassicAPI` fork for World of Warcraft 1.12.1 / Turtle WoW.

### Performance

- Reworked listener bookkeeping to avoid repeated full listener scans and unregister unused events earlier.
- Thread scheduler now stops its `OnUpdate` handler when no live work remains.
- Bounded WDB item-cache scanning to avoid large synchronous warm-cache bursts.
- Replaced permanent merchant polling with one-shot deferred inventory refreshes.
- Added a daily-minimum price cache to avoid repeated SavedVariables history parsing.
- Reduced temporary allocations in historical-value calculations while preserving the existing weighted-median behaviour.
- Throttled Search, Auctions and Bids selection validation to 10 Hz instead of every frame.
- Post-tab heavy UI work now runs only when its state actually changes.
- Autopricing reuses historical-value, charge and disenchant calculations instead of repeating them.
- Reduced tooltip string work and temporary table creation.
- Auction listing rendering stops once all visible rows are filled.
- Selection lookup returns immediately after the selected auction is found.
- LFT price-sharing handling rejects unrelated traffic earlier and reuses cached daily minimums.
- Disenchant tooltip calculations are skipped when both disenchant tooltip options are disabled.

### History & LFT sharing

- Preserved the existing daily-minimum history format and SavedVariables schema.
- `Today` remains the lowest known unit buyout for the current day.
- `Value` remains the long-term historical reference based on up to 11 daily values and an age-weighted median.
- Compatible `AuxData,<item_key>,<unit_buyout_price>` messages received through LFT can update the current daily minimum.
- Searches of 15 pages or more are not broadcast through LFT to reduce channel traffic.
- Embedded ChatThrottleLib behaviour is intentionally unchanged.

### Auction House behaviour

- Auction House server request throttling and query delays are intentionally unchanged.
- Bid, Buyout and Cancel actions retain synchronous validation before execution.
- Existing posting formulas, undercut rules and pricing thresholds are preserved.
- Existing auction grouping, sorting and expand/collapse behaviour is preserved.

### Tooltips & item handling

- Preserved normal tooltip text, colors, requirements and durability checks.
- Durability scanning is only performed where strict auctionability checks require it.
- Optional disenchant value and distribution output remains unchanged when enabled.

### Documentation

- Reworked the README in a compact ShaguTweaks-style format.
- Added documentation for `Value` vs `Today`, LFT price sharing, commands, shortcuts and performance changes.
- Corrected documented posting durations to 6 / 24 / 72 hours.
- Clarified that the repository currently has no hard ClassicAPI dependency and that ShaguTweaks remains optional.

### Validation

The performance changes were tested incrementally in-game on WoW 1.12.1 / Turtle WoW, including Auction House search, Real Time mode, Bid, Buyout, Cancel, Post, merchant updates, tooltips, history and LFT sharing paths.
